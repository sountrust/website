## 🧭 What is Sountrust?

Sountrust is a company focused on building, automating, and evolving infrastructure systems that are secure, scalable, and self-reliant. Our core mission is to support modern organizations — from universities to tech startups — in adopting **code-first infrastructure practices**, **trust-based digital governance**, and **open collaboration models**.

We specialize in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **GitOps**, using modern stacks like Kubernetes, FluxCD, and Terraform. We also maintain a long-term vision toward creating decentralized infrastructure systems for SMEs powered by **DAO principles**, **reputation graphs**, and **smart contracts**.

## 👋 About Me

I'm a DevOps engineer, infrastructure architect, and university contractor. I’ve worked on production-grade Kubernetes clusters, GitOps automation pipelines, and infrastructure on platforms like VMware vCloud Director.

I bring a unique blend of:
- Technical expertise in **Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, Ansible**
- Real-world deployment experience with **MonacoCloud**
- Academic depth (contracting with French universities)
- Strategic thinking (MBA in Global Finance, IAE Nice)

---

## 🚀 What I'm Doing Right Now

- Contracting with universities in France to build out reproducible, modular infrastructures
- Operating entirely through Git (self-hosted GitLab and GitHub), with full CI/CD
- Managing GitOps and infrastructure lifecycle using FluxCD and Terraform modules
- Running multiple environment stacks across projects: dev/staging/prod clusters
- Preparing the groundwork for a **DAO-native infrastructure toolkit** for SMEs

## 🧠 Long-Term Vision: Infrastructure for DAO-Powered SMEs

The future of business lies in **trust-driven, digitally-native networks**. Sountrust aims to support that transition by building tools and infrastructure that allow:

- **SMEs to form alliances and cooperate like DAOs**
- Value exchange based on **contribution, transparency, and reputation**
- Kubernetes-powered orchestration of modular services
- Use of **Rust and smart contracts** to encode trust relationships and business logic
- Integration with distributed systems (IPFS, DHTs) and Web3-native workflows

We’re not chasing hype — we’re laying the foundation for practical decentralized operations.
